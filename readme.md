Tetris in Ruby
===============
NOTE: this game is NOT played by human, but a random/simple AI (the Player object)

To run: type `ruby tetris.rb`

Dependencies
==============
- `rspec` for testing
- the `awesome_print` gem for nicer rendering. Definitely not necessary. If you wish not to install, please manually remove the dependency in board.rb
